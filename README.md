# Iphone-3D-Website

## _*Description*_
  - My third 3D website in this 2nd week of May 2023 using webGl. 
  - In this project I leaned how to position 3d object in multiple pages and how to handle scroll for these objects
  - In this project we can se how Iphone moves b/n different positions as we scroll down. 
  - We can also learn how to manage the state of webGL to set its position dynamic. When we click 'Try Me!' we can move the phone by dragging the mouse.
  - This project is one step forward to previous 2 project related to rendering 3d object and manage thier position using threejs. but this project only use webgl
